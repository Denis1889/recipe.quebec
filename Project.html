<div class="pate"><h2>"Paté chinois"</h2>
<img class="chinois" src="./Images/Chinois.jpg"><p class="year">Shepherd’s pie was invented at the end of the 19th century during the construction of the great Canadian Pacific Railway. At the time, all the workers were fed daily rations of ground beef, potatoes and corn on the cob, which were readily available and inexpensive at that time. Most workers ate their meat, potatoes and corn separately but workers of mainly Asian origins, combined their rations to create shepherd’s pie, a more communal dish. The French-Canadian railway workers liked this new concoction, adopted the dish, and called it “pâté chinois”, which loosely translates to Chinese pie.</p>

<div class="pouding"><h2>"Pouding Chômeur" </h2><img class="chomeur" src="./Images/Pouding.jpg"><p>Pouding chômeur can also be called pouding au chômeur or pouding du chômeur, and translates to “poor man’s pudding” or “unemployment pudding.” It consists of a basic white sponge cake baked on top of a sweet syrup mixture made from brown sugar, water and sometimes milk. The cake batter is poured on top of the warm syrup and baked, the cake rises on top of the syrup and when the cake part is done it then left at room temperature to soak the remaining syrup which stays at the bottom of the pan. The final result is a three layers dessert of moist white cake, soaked cake and syrup.</p><p>The pudding is made up of a classic cake batter using basic and cheap ingredients. As an economical recipe, the batter does not contain eggs, and so does not rise much. Occasionally, eggs would be added to the batter in times when cooks could afford them. The syrup can be made from brown sugar, white sugar, maple syrup or a combination of these. Generally, brown sugar was used in urban areas and maple syrup more used in rural areas, depending on which was easier to access. During the Great Depression, beginning in 1929 and lasting into the 1930s, stale bread was also used instead of cake batter.</p><p>Pouding chômeur is part of the traditional cuisine of Quebec and it is believed that the recipe has been passed down orally. Originally, it was made without exact measurements. This dessert was created by Georgette Falardeau, wife of Camillien Houde, mayor of Montreal, during the start of the Great Depression. Georgette wanted to bring something sweet to soothe the souls of poor and unemployed people. The pouding chômeur was an urban dessert at first since most poor and unemployed people were living in Montreal. It quickly spread throughout the province with some adaptations; some used butter or lard (instead of vegetable shortening) and maple syrup because it was easier to find and cheaper if you were living on a farm or in a remote location.</p><p>he pouding chômeur still remains at this day a classic and popular dessert in Quebec, especially in French-speaking households. It is no longer a dessert associated with poverty, but a staple of the local cuisine. Each family has its own recipe, slightly adapted to their tastes and budget. Nowadays it is often associated to the maple season and served in sugar shacks.</p>

<div class="six"><h2>"six paille"</h2><img class="paille" src="./Images/6pailles.jpg"><p>Cipaille is a traditional French Canadian dish hailing from the Gaspesie and is also known  in different areas of Quebec as cipâtes or six-pâtes (literally, “six doughs”). The name Cipaille is pronounced “Sea Pie,” derivative of the old English dish, Sea Pie, a layered meat or fish pie served to British sailors in the 1700s.</p><p>Essentially it is a large, one-pot dinner made in a Dutch oven that has up to six layers of meats of different animals, separated by layers of pastry. Think of six meat pies, all cooked in one pot, one on top of the other and you get the idea.</p><p>Originally cipaille was made with wild game; hare, elk, venison, moose, duck and partridge were all readily available and they would all go into the cipaille along with onions, celery, carrots and potatoes, and aromatic spices like cinnamon, savory, thyme and juniper berries, each layer separated by a layer of pastry. The entire dish is topped with a final layer of pastry, and hole in the middle allows the cook to pour in the stock or water that the cipaille will cook in.</p><p>Today it is more common to use more readily accessible meats like pork, beef, veal, chicken and rabbit, but if you are lucky enough to get ahold of some wild meats you will have a cipaille that is truer to its heritage. Furthermore, you don’t have to actually make six layers, 2 or 3 is more typical these days. The great thing about this dish is its variety, you can make up any combination of meats that strikes your fancy, although if you are making it for the first time, maybe start out simple.</p>
